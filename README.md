### Algorithm to solve Transportation Problem on UG Campus
Our group has developed an algorithm and implemented it through a Java application, enabling users to easily identify the most favorable route from location A to location B on the UG campus. For instance, if a user selects Great Hall as the starting point and Night Market as the destination, our algorithm ensures that the best route is determined by taking both the shortest distance and the most optimal arrival time into consideration, even in the presence of traffic conditions. We obtained the necessary distance data for all possible routes by utilizing Google Maps or any other suitable mapping application. To calculate the best route and arrival time, we made use of both the Vogel Approximation Method and Critical Path Method, employing a dual approach for enhanced accuracy

### Activities
To assess the effectiveness of our algorithms, we incorporated all the methods taught in our class. Additionally, we organized the distances and arrival times for user selection, employing any preferred sorting algorithm. Our system incorporates a search algorithm that presents multiple routes based on user location choices, like from Night Market to Great Hall, offering at least three alternatives. Furthermore, each route is enriched with four significant landmarks to aid users in making informed decisions. For searching specific landmarks, such as from the University Main Gate to Commonwealth, our system generates all associated routes, streamlining navigation

• We used the “Divide and Conquer” approach (i.e., breaking down the problem into more
subproblems) to write simple but efficient algorithms to solve the problem
•We also used “Greedy and Dynamic Programming approach to optimize the algorithm
